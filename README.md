# StickyColumns - A One Page Organizer

Organize sticky notes in columns. 100% local (no servers), React + CDN, single file.

Sticky Columns is a simple board to manage and plan your tasks; this is a standalone board I use to track my projects and tasks as a freelancer. Your data is saved locally, and the React, Vite and other resources are fetched from CDN.

- Add/edit/delete notes, drag between columns
- Export/Import board JSON
- Dark mode (auto + toggle)

## Use
- Open `StickyColumns-dark-mit.html` in your browser.
- Data is stored in `localStorage` under `sticky-columns:v1`.
- Theme is stored in `localStorage` under `sticky-columns:theme`.
